    <h2 class="headings-h2">who I am</h2>
    <p>ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Yacine.</p>
    <p>I'm a software developer and an optimistic futurist. I am passionate about tech, AI, software engineering,
        and
        web development.</p>
    <p>Consider me as your go-to problem solver for any tasks that involve systems engineering, software
        engineering,
        deployment, and for training your team as well. I am a passionate lifelong learner, and I'm eager to tackle
        your
        next challenges, regardless of the technologies you are using: it's not about the tools, it's about which
        ones
        you chose and how you use them to build and repair your systems ;) I've made the commitment to always stay
        on
        top of things, tech-wise, so count me in as your powerful and versatile ally to face the complexity of your
        challenges.</p>
    <p>After ten years of service in the French Ground Army and various missions abroad, I've came back to the
        civilian
        life and realized how much technology has the potential to empower and improve everyone's life, from the
        little
        things that make it more pleasant to the big issues that we need to resolve as a society: this is why, in
        2018,
        I've decided to become a software developer.</p>
    <h2 class="headings-h2">what I do</h2>
    <p>As a builder, I can help you create and maintain:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>full-stack distributed web applications using various software programming languages (Python, Node.js,
            PHP,
            .NET), environments (on-premise, serverless, Kubernetes), and databases (PostgreSQL, MongoDB,)</li>
        <li>optimizations to manage the complexity of your application stacks by leveraging caches and queues
            (Redis),
            messaging systems (Pub/Sub), telemetry (for instance, with Google Cloud monitoring offerings), and more!
        </li>
        <li>CI/CD pipelines on the GCP and serverless solutions using Kubernetes or plain containers, for instance
            with
            Google Cloud Run</li>
        <li>powerful generative AI workflows to meet your organizational goals (RAG systems, agentic data
            collection,
            public facing agentic natural language interfaces, etc.) using tools like LangChain, LangGraph, or
            LlamaIndex</li>
        <li>ML computer vision or tabular data models that can be deployed on various stacks, even legacy ones
            (using
            ONNX)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>As a trainer, I can teach you and your team all of the above so that your organization can navigate technical
        challenges with ease!</p>
    <p>I had the opportunity of working for a wide array of organizations, of various scales, using a wide array of
        technologies. Some of my work included:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>building chatbots to help employees of a construction cie take their vacation from within a messaging
            application on their smartphone, greatly reducing the workload for the HR department</li>
        <li>deploying high-traffic websites that are visited daily by one-fourth of the English-speaking world (<a
                href="https://www.cinemablend.com/">cinemablend.com</a>, <a
                href="https://www.whattowatch.com/">whattowatch.com</a>, <a
                href="https://moneyweek.com/">moneyweek</a>,
            and many other <a href="https://futureplc.com/">Future PLC</a> websites, where I worked as DevOps
            Software
            Engineer)</li>
        <li>deploying a computer vision model to meet an OCR SLA for a cie that needed to process hand-written forms
            at
            scale; the solution I've implemented using PyTorch saw an increase of 30% hand-written forms correctly
            parsed</li>
        <li>building and deploying a web API and its frontend for <a href="https://qperfect.io/">a startup that
                provides
                quantum computing as a service</a> so that their team could focus on their core product</li>
        <li>training adults to write and deploy software for well-known e-learning and in situ training platforms,
            such
            as <a href="https://www.udacity.com/">Udacity</a>, <a
                href="https://openclassrooms.com/en/">OpenClassrooms</a>, and <a
                href="https://www.wildcodeschool.com/fr-fr/">Wild Code School</a>: one of my greatest prides is that
            several of my students did find a job and are now accomplished software developers!</li>
        <li>â€¦ and many more stuff!</li>
    </ul>
