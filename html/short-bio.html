<h2 class="headings-h2">who I am</h2>
<p>ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Yacine.</p>
<p>I'm a software developer and a truly optimistic futurist. I am passionate about tech, AI, software engineering, and web development.</p>
<p>Consider me as your go-to problem solver for any tasks that involve systems engineering, software engineering, deployment, and for training your team as well. I am a passionate lifelong learner, and I'm eager to tackle your next challenges, regardless of the technologies you are using: it's not about the tools, it's about which ones you chose and how you use them to build and repair your systems ;) I've made the commitment to always stay on top of things, tech-wise, so count me in as your powerful and versatile ally to face the complexity of your challenges.</p>
<p>After ten years of service in the French Ground Army and various missions abroad, I've came back to the civilian life and realized how much technology has the potential to empower and improve everyone's life, from the little things that make it more pleasant to the big issues that we need to resolve as a society: this is why, in 2018,  I've decided to become a software developer.</p>
<h2 class="headings-h2">what I do</h2>
<p>As a builder, I can help you create and maintain:</p>
<ul>
<li>full-stack distributed web applications using various software programming languages (Python, Node.js, PHP, .NET), environments (on-premise, serverless, Kubernetes), and databases (PostgreSQL, MongoDB,)</li>
<li>optimizations to manage the complexity of your application stacks by leveraging caches and queues (Redis), messaging systems (Pub/Sub), telemetry (for instance, with Google Cloud monitoring offerings), and more!</li>
<li>CI/CD pipelines on the GCP and serverless solutions using Kubernetes or plain containers, for instance with Google Cloud Run</li>
<li>powerful generative AI workflows to meet your organizational goals (RAG systems, agentic data collection, public facing agentic natural language interfaces, etc.) using tools like LangChain, LangGraph, or LlamaIndex</li>
<li>ML computer vision or tabular data models that can be deployed on various stacks, even legacy ones (using ONNX)</li>
</ul>
<p>As a trainer, I can teach you and your team all of the above so that your organization can navigate technical challenges with ease!</p>
<p>I had the opportunity of working for a wide array of organizations, of various scales, using a wide array of technologies. Some of my work included:</p>
<ul>
<li>building chatbots to help employees of a construction cie take their vacation from within a messaging application on their smartphone, greatly reducing the workload for the HR department</li>
<li>deploying high-traffic websites that are visited daily by one-fourth of the English-speaking world (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.cinemablend.com/">cinemablend.com</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.whattowatch.com/">whattowatch.com</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://moneyweek.com/">moneyweek</a>, and many other <a target="_blank" href="https://futureplc.com/">Future PLC</a> websites, where I worked as DevOps Software Engineer)</li>
<li>deploying a computer vision model to meet an OCR SLA for a cie that needed to process hand-written forms at scale; the solution I've implemented using PyTorch saw an increase of 30% hand-written forms correctly parsed</li>
<li>building and deploying a web API and its frontend for <a target="_blank" href="https://qperfect.io/">a startup that provides quantum computing as a service</a> so that their team could focus on their core product</li>
<li>training adults to write and deploy software for well-known e-learning and in situ training platforms, such as <a target="_blank" href="https://www.udacity.com/">Udacity</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://openclassrooms.com/en/">OpenClassrooms</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wildcodeschool.com/fr-fr/">Wild Code School</a>: one of my greatest prides is that several of my students did find a job and are now accomplished software developers!</li>
<li>â€¦ and many more stuff!</li>
